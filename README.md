## Starter Code Overview

The code is more or less directly translated from the ml5 page, along with some drawing functionality, and the ability to generate random data with which to use the classifier. 

Here is a description of the dataset. 

> There are 10 predictors, all quantitative, and a binary dependent variable, indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer. The predictors are anthropometric data and parameters which can be gathered in routine blood analysis. Prediction models based on these predictors, if accurate, can potentially be used as a biomarker of breast cancer. Quantitative Attributes: Age (years) BMI (kg/m2) Glucose (mg/dL) Insulin (µU/mL) HOMA Leptin (ng/mL) Adiponectin (µg/mL) Resistin (ng/mL) MCP-1(pg/dL) Labels: 1=Healthy controls 2=Patients.
